## Project Overview

Poverty eradication is a key challenge of the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals. In Bolivia, around 34% of the population (~3M people) lived in poverty in 2020, yet current data collection methods like censuses are expensive and infrequent.

This project proposes a machine learning approach using satellite imagery to estimate poverty in Bolivia, focusing on La Paz as a representative area. Images were collected from Google Static Maps (RGB), and a ResNet-50 model was used to classify areas into three levels of poverty using unsatisfied basic needs (UBN) surveys.

### Results

The models classify poverty into three levels: low, medium, and high. The best prediction results after several tests are summarized below:

| Category | Model A Accuracy | Model B Accuracy |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Low      | 0.814           | 0.529           |
| Medium   | 0.230           | 0.856           |
| High     | 0.972           | 0.795           |

<ul>
	<li> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/ok--v1.png" width="20"/> <b>Model A</b> (trained on a balanced dataset) performs best in the low and high poverty categories. </li>
	<li> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/ok--v1.png" width="20"/> <b>Model B</b> achieves higher accuracy in the medium poverty category. </li>
</ul>

<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/idea.png" width="20"/> This approach is cost-effective, scalable, and fully based on public data, offering a practical tool for demographic, social, and statistical studies.

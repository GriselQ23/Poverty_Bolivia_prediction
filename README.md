# Poverty_Bolivia_prediction
In this repository we can find a deep learning model to predict Poverty in Bolivia through satellite imagery. 
Script interfaz run on Jupyter notebook and use tkinter to show the category prediction and if the image is rural or urban. 
Script ResNet4 is protyped on Google Colab. Train and save a model with ResNet-50 architecture. 
Script Visualize filters (still in process), get the model saved and the weights. We can see how is the image changing meanwhile goes through ResNet.
Script Predicccion_y_evaluacion predict and use confusion matrix to evaluate the model performance.
